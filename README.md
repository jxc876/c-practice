# About

A simple repo to practice working with the fundamentals of C.

For my editor I'm using CLion, but hoping to explore XCode as well.
* https://www.jetbrains.com/clion
* https://developer.apple.com/xcode

Each subfolder contains a specific exercise to explore a concept.

## characters

Code to extracts letters, numbers & special chars from an input string.

This exercise is interesting because C requires allocating & release memory manually.

- `characters/charsv1.c` â€” works, but duplicates looping code
- `characters/charsv2.c` â€” improves on v1 by using a function pointer to avoid duplication


Build:

```shell
cc charsv1.c -o charsv1
./main
```

## headers

Practicing using header files â€” Under Construction ðŸš§

Splits a function into interface (`greeting.h`) & definition (`greting.c`)

```shell
cd headers

# compile object files
gcc -c greeting.c
gcc -c say_hello.c

# final binary
gcc -o bin/say_hello greeting.o say_hello.o

# execute
./bin/say_hello
Hello, World!

# clean up
rm *.o
```
