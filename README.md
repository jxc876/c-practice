# About

A simple repo to practice working with the fundamentals of C and it's toolchain.

I'm using CLion as my editor, but would like to explore XCode as well.

# Folders

Each subfolder contains a specific exercise to explore a concept.

## characters

`characters/main.c` â€” extracts letters, numbers & special chars from a string

This one is interesting because C requires allocating & release memory manually.

Unlike Java, JS, or Python you are responsible ðŸ¥²

Build:

```shell
cc main.c -o main
./main
```

## headers

Practicing using header files â€” Under Construction ðŸš§

Splits a function into `greting.c` & `greeting.h`
